The argon atoms form an equilateral triangle with side lengths of 3.82 Ã… and angles of 60$^{\circ}$. This is expected, since if, for example, Ar$_1$ reaches an energy minimum with respect to the other two atoms, this same configuration should also put Ar$_2$ and Ar$_3$ into their energy minima. This leads to the result that all three atoms must be in identical environments with respect to their neighbors, which must be an equilateral triangle. Each side is the same length as the minimum energy distance for Ar$_2$, which also makes sense.

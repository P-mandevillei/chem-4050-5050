The work done by an ideal gas on the surroundings in an isothermal expansion is always greater than the work done in an adiabatic process for the same volume change. This makes chemical sense. $\Delta U = w + q$, in the adiabatic process, $q=0$, $w<0$, so $\Delta U<0$. Since $\Delta U = n C_v \Delta T$ for ideal gas, $\Delta T<0$. The ideal gas law states that $PV=nRT$, so if $T$ decreases, $P$ must also decrease. Therefore for the adiabatic process, the pressure integrand is also less than that in the isothermal process.
